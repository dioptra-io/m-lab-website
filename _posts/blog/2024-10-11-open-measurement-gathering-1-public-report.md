As shared in our last blog post, In June 2024 Measurement Lab (M-Lab) co-organized and participated in the first of four convenings that will take place over the course of the Open Measurement Gatherings (OMG) project. The public report from that event can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/OMG1_PublicReport.pdf). 

We look forward to our next event in December and to continuing to strengthen the open Internet measurement community!
